DVK-TETRIS

Port of the TETRIS game originally written for Soviet DVK-2 computer.  
Look and feel kept to the original as close as possible.

Currently (first commit) the game is supposed to be compiled (g++) and run under Linux.
Further developement requires adding score board; my the second commit I should 
finish these things.
